# Defining variables and if else statement for userRole and accessLevel

1. Declare variable named userRole and initialize it with the string value "admin" in control_flow.js file. Also, declare one more variable named accessLevel but do not assign a value to it yet.

```javascript
let userRole = "admin";
let accessLevel;
```

2. Now, execute the if…else block by assigning different roles in the if…else condition to check if userRole is equal to "admin"or not. Include the following code in the control_flow.js file after the previous code:

```javascript 
if (userRole === "admin") {
    accessLevel = "Full access granted";
} else if (userRole === "manager") {
    accessLevel = "Limited access granted";
} else {
    accessLevel = "No access granted";
}
```

3. Now, the above code will check if userRole is "admin" or something else.

- If userRole is "admin", the code with assign accessLevel as "Full access granted".
- If not, it will proceed to check if userRole is "manager".
- If userRole is "manager", it will assign accessLevel as "Limited access granted".
- If userRole is neither "admin" nor "manager", the code will assign accessLevel as "No access granted".

4. Based on the value of userRole, the accessLevel variable will be set to one of the following:

- "Full access granted" if userRole === "admin"
- "Limited access granted" if userRole === "manager"
- "No access granted" for any other value of userRole

You will be able to see the output using this code:

```javascript
console.log("Access Level:", accessLevel);
```
