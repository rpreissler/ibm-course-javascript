# Defining variables and switch statement for userType and userCategory

1. Declare a variable named userType and initialize it with the string value "subscriber" in control_flow.js file. Declare one more variable named userCategory but do not assign a value to it yet. Insert the provided code after the previous code.

```javascript 
let userType = "subscriber";
let userCategory;
```

2. Now, you need to implement and execute the switch statement to evaluate the value of userType by providing different case values:

```javascript
switch (userType) {
    case "admin":
        userCategory = "Administrator";
        break;
    case "manager":
        userCategory = "Manager";
        break;
    case "subscriber":
        userCategory = "Subscriber";
        break;
    default:
        userCategory = "Unknown";
}
```

3. The output for cases depend upon its value, such as:

- Case "admin":
    - If userType is "admin", userCategory is assigned as "Administrator".
    - break; exits the switch statement after the assignment.
- Case "manager":
    - If userType is "manager", userCategory is assigned as "Manager".
    - break; exits the switch statement after the assignment.
- Case "subscriber":
    - If userType is "subscriber", userCategory is assigned as "Subscriber".
    - break; exits the switch statement after the assignment.
- Default Case:
    - If userType doesn't match any defined cases ("admin", "manager", or "subscriber"), userCategory is assigned as "Unknown".

4. You can use the following console method to view the output:
```javascript
console.log("User Category:", userCategory);
```

5. You will see the output as User Category: Subscriber because the default value of userType is subscriber.

```bash
Access Level: Full access granted
User Message: Welcome, Admin!
User Category: Subscriber
```
