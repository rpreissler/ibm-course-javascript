# Use ternary operator for isAuthenticated and authenticationStatus

1. Declare a variable named isAuthenticated and initialize it with the boolean value true in control_flow.js file.
```javascript
let isAuthenticated = true;
```

2. Declare one more variable named authenticationStatus and use a ternary operator (? :) to see if the user is authenticated or not.

```javascript 
let authenticationStatus = isAuthenticated ? "Authenticated" : "Not authenticated";
```

3. Now the condition will be checked.

- If isAuthenticated is true, the expression before : (in this case, "Authenticated") is assigned to authenticationStatus.
- If isAuthenticated is false, the expression after : (in this case, "Not authenticated") is assigned to authenticationStatus.

4. You can use the following console method to view the output:

```javascript
console.log("Authentication Status:", authenticationStatus);
```
